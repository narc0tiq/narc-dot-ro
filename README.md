This is the code that used to be behind [Narc Dot Ro](http://www.narc.ro/). It is made available in the hope it will be useful to somebody, at some point.

Of note is that the website itself is quite tiny and readable: though a few edits may need to be made for a different website, it's easy to find where the edits are to be made, and what they should be. This is the quintessential example of straightforwardness, in my opinion.

Also of note is this is intended for a small site: the administration page would become fairly unwieldy with large numbers of articles and/or large numbers of available downloads. This may be improved, in time, if it proves necessary. For now, it serves my purposes wonderfully.

You are welcome to consider the work Public Domain, or otherwise under the least strict licensing terms available in your legal area. Do with it as you will, I'm just making the thing.

As of 2013-07-30, it is no longer deployed: the live site is now using [basically the same thing, written in Python](https://github.com/narc0tiq/py.narc.ro). If anything, the Python version is even smaller and more readable, while incrementally more powerful. Note there is no migration path other than manually doing so; if you need help migrating, [let me know](http://www.narc.ro/contact) and I'll try to help.
